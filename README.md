# Detecting and Measuring Confounding using Causal Mechanism Shifts

We propose consider different settings in which we propose methods to detect and measure confounding. In each of the setting, code is split into three files: generate_data.py, confounding_measure.py and evaluate.py which one has to execute in that order to reproduce the results in the paper. Next, generate_data.py, as the name suggests, will generate synthetic data. confounding_measure.py will measure confounding (if present) and the results are stored in separate files. Finally, evaluate.py produeces the evaluation metric values.
